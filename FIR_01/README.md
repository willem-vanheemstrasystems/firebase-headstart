Based on 'Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App - Friendly Chat' at https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/#0

##1 Overview

In this codelab, you'll learn how to use the Firebase platform to easily create Web applications and you will implement and deploy a chat client using Firebase.

***What you'll learn***

- Sync data using the Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage.

- Authenticate your users using Firebase Auth.

- Deploy your web app on Firebase static hosting.

***What you'll need***

- The IDE/text editor of your choice such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

- The sample code.

- A browser such as Chrome.

##2 Get the sample code

Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat) from the command line:

```javascript
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat
```

The firebase-codelabs repository contains sample projects for multiple platforms. This codelab only uses these two repositories:

- ***web-start*** — The starting code that you'll build upon in this codelab.

- ***web*** — The complete code for the finished sample app.

Note: If you would like to run the finished app, you will still have to create a project in the Firebase console, see the ***Create a Firebase project and Setup your app*** section for instructions.
